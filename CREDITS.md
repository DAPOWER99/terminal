# Acknowledgements

DAXEL terminal stands on the shoulders of giants. We want to thank:

## Core Technologies

- **[Python](https://www.python.org/)** - The powerful programming language that makes DAXEL possible
- **[Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/)** - For providing robust built-in modules:
  - `os`, `sys` - System operations and path handling
  - `shutil` - File operations and disk usage
  - `readline` - Command line editing and history
  - `argparse` - Command line argument parsing
  - `platform` - System information detection

## Python Ecosystem

- **[Prompt Toolkit](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit)** - For advanced CLI features (if used)
- **[Click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/)** - For beautiful command line interfaces (if used)
- **[Pygments](https://pygments.org/)** - For syntax highlighting (if used)
- **[Rich](https://github.com/Textualize/rich)** - For rich terminal formatting (if used)

## Inspiration

- **Unix/Linux shells** (bash, zsh, fish) - For the philosophy of composable tools
- **Windows Command Prompt & PowerShell** - For different shell design approaches
- **IPython** - For showing how powerful Python-based shells can be
- **Modern terminals** - For pushing the boundaries of terminal user experience

## Special Thanks

- The Python community for excellent documentation and libraries
- Early testers who provided valuable feedback on cross-platform compatibility
- Contributors who helped identify and fix Windows/Linux/macOS specific issues
