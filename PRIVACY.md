# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** [10/23/2025]

## 1. Introduction

This Privacy Policy explains how Daxel ("we," "our," or "the application") handles information when you use our terminal application. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to:
- The Daxel terminal application
- Any related services or APIs provided by the application
- Data processed through your use of the application

## 3. Information We Do Not Collect

We designed Daxel with privacy in mind. The application:

**Does NOT collect or transmit:**
- Personal identification information (name, email, address, etc.)
- Usage statistics or analytics data
- Device information (hardware specs, unique device identifiers)
- IP addresses or location data
- Files or content you process with the application
- Keystrokes or command history (beyond what's necessary for application functionality)

## 4. Information That May Be Processed Locally

The application may process the following data **locally on your device**:

### 4.1 Configuration Data
- Settings and preferences you configure
- API keys or credentials you provide for integrated services
- Custom templates or configuration files you create

### 4.2 Operational Data
- Files or data you explicitly provide as input to the application
- Command history within the current session (if implementing interactive features)
- Temporary cache files for performance optimization

### 4.3 Log Files (Optional)
- Local debug logs if you enable logging features
- Error reports that you can choose to review before sharing

**All this data remains on your local machine unless you explicitly choose to share it.**

## 5. Third-Party Services

### 5.1 External APIs
If you configure the application to use external APIs or services:
- You must provide your own API keys
- Any data sent to third-party services is governed by their respective privacy policies
- We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any external services you integrate

### 5.2 Package Managers
If installed via package managers (Homebrew, pip, npm, etc.):
- Standard installation metrics may be collected by the package manager
- Refer to the respective package manager's privacy policy for details

## 6. Data Storage and Retention

### 6.1 Local Storage
- Configuration files: Stored in  A Logs Folder or appropriate platform-specific location
- Cache files: Stored temporarily and automatically cleaned up
- Log files: Rotated and deleted based on your configuration

### 6.2 Data Retention
- You control all data retention through your local file system
- Uninstalling the application removes all local configuration and data
- No data is retained on our servers (as we don't operate any)

## 7. Data Sharing and Disclosure

**We do not share, sell, or disclose your data to third parties** because:

- The application doesn't transmit data to our servers
- All processing occurs locally on your machine
- No telemetry or analytics are embedded in the application

### 7.1 Legal Exceptions
In the extremely unlikely event that we were legally compelled to provide information, we would:
- Notify you unless legally prohibited
- Only provide information that we actually possess (which is minimal)
- Challenge overly broad requests

## 8. Security

### 8.1 Local Security
The application relies on your system's security measures:
- Files are stored with standard file system permissions
- No additional encryption is applied beyond your system's capabilities
- You are responsible for securing your API keys and configuration files

### 8.2 Best Practices We Recommend
- Store configuration files in secure locations
- Use environment variables for sensitive data like API keys
- Regularly review and clean up old configuration files
- Keep your system and the application updated

## 9. Your Rights and Choices

Since all data remains on your device, you have complete control:

### 9.1 Access and Modification
- Access all application data through your local file system
- Modify or delete configuration files at any time
- Review local logs and cache files

### 9.2 Data Deletion
- Remove all application data by uninstalling the application
- Delete specific configuration files without affecting core functionality
- Clear cache files using built-in application commands

## 10. Open Source Transparency

As an open source project:
- The source code is publicly available for review
- You can verify our privacy claims by examining the code
- Community contributions are welcome to improve privacy features

## 11. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy as the application evolves. We will:
- Update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy
- Notify users of significant changes through GitHub releases
- Archive previous versions in the project repository

## 12. Legal Compliance

### 12.1 No Illegal Use
**This application is provided for legitimate and legal purposes only.** You agree not to use this service for any illegal activities or to facilitate illegal activities. Users are solely responsible for ensuring their compliance with applicable laws.

### 12.2 Warranty Disclaimer
This application is provided **"as is"** without any warranties. We assume no liability for how you use the application or what data you process with it.
