## Using Daxel Terminal Safely

### Understanding System Access
Daxel Terminal executes real system commands with the same permissions as your user account. This means:

- **Commands run with your privileges** - be careful what you execute
- **System monitoring features** access hardware information
- **Clipboard manager** can read and modify your clipboard
- **File operations** can modify your file system

### Safe Command Practices

#### ‚úÖ DO:
- Review unfamiliar commands before executing
- Use built-in commands (`help`, `system`, `battery`) when possible
- Check command outputs for unexpected behavior
- Keep Daxel Terminal updated to the latest version

#### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Run commands from untrusted sources without understanding them
- Use Daxel Terminal for illegal or malicious activities
- Execute commands that could damage your system
- Share sensitive information in command outputs

### Clipboard Security
The clipboard manager feature:
- Stores your clipboard history locally
- Can access anything you copy while monitoring is active
- Only use this feature when you trust the application

### Network and System Information
Daxel Terminal can display:
- System specifications
- Network configuration
- Running processes
- Hardware status

This information stays local unless you explicitly share it.

### Verifying Authenticity
Always download Daxel Terminal from official sources:
- **Primary**: https://github.com/DAPOWER99/terminal
- Verify you're using the correct repository
- Check commit signatures when possible

### Code Transparency
Daxel Terminal is open source so you can:
- Review the source code before running
- Verify what commands and system access occur
- Understand exactly what the application does

### Reporting Security Issues
Found a vulnerability? Please report it responsibly:
1. **Do not disclose publicly** immediately
2. **Create a private security advisory** on GitHub
3. **Provide detailed steps** to reproduce the issue
